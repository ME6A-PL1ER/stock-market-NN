~~# Trading Agent with Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that learns to trade the XRP/USDT pair using Binance's 1-hour historical price data. The agent is built using PyTorch and Gym, and it employs a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for trading decisions.

## Features

- Fetches historical price data (1-hour candles) from Binance for the XRP/USDT pair.
- Custom Gym environment simulates trading actions (buy, sell, hold).
- Deep Q-Network (DQN) is used for decision-making and policy learning.
- Supports GPU acceleration using PyTorch (CUDA-compatible).
- Real-time performance rendering using matplotlib.

## Prerequisites

To run the code, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch gym pandas requests matplotlib~~
```
